# Task 1: Working with String Methods
Create a new Java class called StringLab.

Inside the main() method:

Create a String variable with the value: " Welcome to the Java String Lab! ".
Use the following methods on this string and print the results:
length(): Print the length of the string.
charAt(): Print the character at index 7.
substring(): Extract and print the word "Java" from the string.
toUpperCase() and toLowerCase(): Print both the uppercase and lowercase versions.
indexOf(): Find and print the index of the first occurrence of "Java".
contains(): Check if the string contains the word "Lab" and print the result.
replace(): Replace "Java" with "Java Programming" and print the result.
split(): Split the string by spaces and print each word using a for loop.
trim(): Trim any leading or trailing spaces and print the result.
equals() and equalsIgnoreCase(): Compare the string "java string lab!" with " Welcome to the Java String Lab! " and print the results.

# Task 2: Loop Challenges with Strings
üåÄ For Loop: Count Vowels
Write a for loop to count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are in the original string. Print the result.

üîÅ While Loop: Check for Palindrome
Create a new String variable with a single word (e.g., "racecar").

Use a while loop to check if the word is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward). Print whether it is or not.

üîÇ Do...While Loop: Input Validation
Prompt the user to enter a sentence.

Use a do...while loop to repeat the prompt until the user types a sentence that contains the word "Java".

Once the condition is met, print "Thank you!".

# Task 3: Working with StringBuilder
Create a StringBuilder object initialized with "StringBuilder Lab". Perform the following operations:

append(): Add " - Learning Java" to the StringBuilder.
insert(): Insert " is fun" after the word "Lab".
delete(): Delete the word "Learning" from the StringBuilder.
reverse(): Reverse the entire string and print it.

# Task 4: Working with StringBuffer
Create a StringBuffer object initialized with "Multithreading Lab".

Perform the same operations as in Task 3:
                    append()
                    insert()
                    delete()
                    reverse()
